 * would be needed for and nothing a member could reach that is not theirs.
 *
 * The timezone warning is the point of the panel rather than decoration on it. Day boundaries are
 * computed per person, and `daily` is keyed by the local date the old zone produced, so moving
 * this column files every derived row under a day that is no longer theirs until a rebuild from
 * the archive replays them. That is minutes of work and it happens at the next start, so it is
