/**
 * The sleep balance card's chart: one bar per night, drawn as its signed deviation from a zero
 * line rather than as a value measured from the axis floor.
 *
 * A separate component from DailyBars, not a flag on it, and the difference is the axis contract
 * rather than a preference. DailyBars starts its value axis at zero deliberately, because a bar's
 * LENGTH is its value there and a truncated axis would misstate the ratio between two days; that
 * is the whole reason it carries `min: 0` and a comment saying so. This chart's bars are
 * deviations, half of them negative by construction, and clamping them to a floor at zero would
 * draw a night two hours under its target as a bar of length zero. So the extent here is symmetric
 * around zero and the zero line is drawn as a dashed markLine instead, which is the thing that
 * carries "this is where the comparison sits" in the axis's absence.
 *
 * What it does NOT change is the accessible table, the marks or the click resolution: all three go
 * through the same shared helpers DailyBars uses (dayTableRows, dayMarks, dayPointDate), because a
 * canvas and a table that disagree about a day are the defect this project treats as binding.
