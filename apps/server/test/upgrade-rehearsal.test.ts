// The upgrade path, walked end to end: an old database migrated to head, rebuilt from its own
// archive, offered to the reclaim, backed up, and restored over itself.
//
// Every one of those five things has a unit test of its own. None of them has ever been run in
// sequence by anything but a person, by hand, against a copy of a real instance - which is how
// this milestone found three defects that exist only on the upgrade path, one of them capable of
// bricking an instance. This file is that person.
//
// The asymmetry below is the design rather than an accident. The **old** database is built here,
// by replaying the repository's own migrations 0000 to 0015 and recording them the way drizzle's
// migrator records them. The **upgrade** is `openHaelan`, the function a user's boot calls, and
// `migrateToLatest` underneath it, which hardcodes its migrations folder on purpose: a boot that
// can be pointed at a different migration set is a boot that can be pointed at the wrong one. So
// only the fixture building is bespoke, and the thing under test is the real thing.
//
// No timing assertion appears anywhere in this file. What survives each step is the question;
// how long a step took is not, and three flaky-test incidents on this project came from
// answering the second one on a shared runner.

/**
 * A database at migration `throughTag`, built by replaying the repository's own migration files.
 *
 * Drizzle's own `migrate()`, pointed at a temp folder holding a trimmed journal, would be the
 * obvious way to do this - but `drizzle-orm` is `@haelan/core`'s dependency and this package does
 * not declare it, the same constraint `v1-etag.test.ts` already works around. Declaring it here
 * for one fixture would put a package into `@haelan/server` that nothing it ships uses, and drag
 * an unrelated dependency-resolution change through the lockfile with it.
 *
 * What is reproduced instead is small, and it is checked immediately. Drizzle decides what to
 * apply purely by comparing each journal entry's `when` against the newest `created_at` in
 * `__drizzle_migrations` - the hash it records is written and never read back - so one row per
 * applied migration carrying its journal timestamp is the whole of the bookkeeping. And a fixture
 * that got that wrong cannot pass quietly: `migrateToLatest` runs against this same file moments
 * later and would either replay 0000 and throw on a table that already exists, or skip 0016 and
 * leave the rebuild reading a `samples` table with no `person_ref` column. Step 2 pins the
 * migration count for the same reason.
